## Current Development Setup

### Why Local Development?
We're currently running in **local development mode** for several important reasons:

1. **Safe Testing Environment**: Testing with local Bitcoin simulation eliminates financial risk
2. **Rapid Iteration**: Local development allows fast testing and debugging
3. **Cost-Free Testing**: No real gas fees or transaction costs during development
4. **Full Control**: Complete control over the testing environment

### Local Asset Implementation

#### What is Local Assets?
- **Simulated Bitcoin balances** stored in local canister
- **Real SEI testnet token balances** for testing SEI acceleration functionality
- **Simulated transactions** on local blockchain
- **Same API interface** as mainnet assets for seamless transition

#### Current Local Balance Setup:
```bash
# 1 BTC simulated balance (100,000,000 satoshis)
setLocalBitcoinBalance(principal, 100_000_000)

# 1000 SEI testnet balance (1,000,000,000 usei)
setSeiTestnetBalance(principal, 1_000_000_000)

# Display: 1.00000000 BTC + 1000.000000 SEI
# Value: Simulated BTC + Real testnet SEI
```

#### Local Addresses:
- Recipients get realistic addresses for UI display
- Simulated blockchain network interaction for Bitcoin
- Real testnet interaction for SEI
- Bitcoin addresses like: `bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh`
- SEI addresses like: `sei1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh`

## Core Workflows

### 1. Deposit Flow
```
External BTC → Bitcoin Network → cKBTC (Chain-Key Bitcoin) → User Balance
```
- **Deposit**: Send Bitcoin from external wallet to cKBTC address
- **Conversion**: Bitcoin automatically converted to cKBTC via ICP's Chain-Key Bitcoin
- **Balance**: cKBTC appears in user's SafeSplit balance
- **SEI Integration**: SEI Network used to accelerate Bitcoin transactions

### 2. Escrow Creation
```
Input: ICP Principal IDs + BTC Amount + Percentages + SEI Acceleration
↓
Backend: Validate balances and create escrow
↓
Result: Pending escrow with recipient details
```

### 3. Recipient Approval
```
Recipients: Approve/Decline escrow
↓
System: Track approval status
↓
Result: All approved = ready for release
```

### 4. Release Escrow
```
Sender: Release escrow
↓
System: Update internal local balances
↓
Result: Recipients receive simulated assets
```

### 5. Cancellation & Decline
```
Sender: Cancel escrow → Full refund to sender
Recipient: Decline escrow → Refund to sender + reputation penalty
```

### 6. Withdrawal Flow
```
User initiates withdrawal → System validates balance and address → 
Funds deducted from user account → Transaction recorded → 
Withdrawal completed with transaction ID
```

## Mainnet Transition

### Zero Logic Changes Required
The beauty of our architecture is that **no code changes** are needed for mainnet:

```typescript
// Same function calls work on both local and mainnet
getCkbtcBalance(principal)     // Mock → Real cKBTC
getSeiBalance(principal)       // Mock → Real SEI tokens (for acceleration)
getBitcoinAddress(principal)   // Mock → Real Bitcoin address
getSeiAddress(principal)       // Mock → Real SEI address (for acceleration)
initiateEscrow(participants)   // Same logic, real transactions
```

### What Changes on Mainnet:

#### 1. Real Asset Integration
- **Local**: Mock balances in canister
- **Mainnet**: Real cKBTC and SEI tokens (for Bitcoin acceleration)
- **Cost**: Real asset balances required

#### 2. Real Addresses
- **Local**: Generated mock addresses
- **Mainnet**: User-provided real addresses
- **Validation**: Real address format checking

#### 3. Real Transaction Fees
- **Local**: No fees
- **Mainnet**: ICP cycles + blockchain network fees

---

## Mainnet Cost Breakdown

### Total Costs for Mainnet Deployment:

#### 1. ICP Cycles (One-time)
- **Canister deployment**: ~1-2 ICP
- **Threshold ECDSA setup**: ~0.5 ICP
- **Total ICP cost**: ~2-3 ICP ($60-90 at current rates)

#### 2. Blockchain Network Fees (Per Transaction)
- **cKBTC to BTC conversion**: ~$2-10 per transaction
- **Bitcoin network fees**: Variable based on network congestion
- **SEI acceleration fees**: ~$0.01-0.10 per transaction
- **Typical escrow release**: $5-15 total fees

#### 3. Asset Balance Requirements
- **For testing**: Real cKBTC and SEI tokens needed (for acceleration)
- **Minimum viable**: 0.001 BTC (~$60) + 10 SEI (~$10) for testing
- **Production**: Depends on expected transaction volume

### Fee Structure Example:
```
Escrow Amount: 0.1 BTC ($6,000)
↓
cKBTC to BTC Fee: $5
Bitcoin Network Fee: $3
SEI Acceleration Fee: $0.05
Total Fees: $8.05 (0.13% of transaction)
```

- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns and warns users about potential risks

### Additional AI Capabilities:
- **Balance Queries**: "What's my current balance?" → Real-time balance display
- **Transaction History**: "Show my recent transactions" → Filtered transaction list
- **Address Management**: "Set my Bitcoin/SEI address" → Guided address setup
- **Navigation Help**: Context-aware assistance for platform navigation

### AI Technology Stack:
- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: For natural language understanding
- **Local Fallback Parser**: Ensures functionality even without API access
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history and user preferences
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant responses to user queries

### Example AI Interactions:
```
User: "I want to send 0.2 BTC to John and Sarah"
AI: "I'll help you create an escrow. How would you like to split the 0.2 BTC between John and Sarah?"

User: "Should I approve this escrow from user123?"
AI: "Let me analyze this escrow: Amount: 0.1 BTC, Sender reputation: Good, Transaction pattern: Normal. I recommend APPROVING this escrow."

User: "What's my current balance?"
AI: "Your current balance is 1.00000000 BTC ($60,000.00). You have 0 pending escrows."
